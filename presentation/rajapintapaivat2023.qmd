## Data collection from Telegram

- Nice API!
- But no global search :(

# Existing tools

Many libraries/apps bundle these together:

- Data collection: Exporting messages and media from list of channels
- Visualisation / analysis

But scholars still need to DIY:

- Discovery - finding most important sources
- Sampling - systematically selecting channels for a dataset

# Existing directories of Telegram

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Problems:

- Few channels from Europe
- Opaque about methodology

# Snowball sampling

- Sampling typically happens by following citations between samples
- Parameters: Seedlist of channels, how far to go in history, prioritising channels for next step...
- Researchers have to learn how to work the API anyway!

# tg_snowball aims

- Publishing channel metadata and citations graphs
- Making it transparent and replicable enough to allow scholarly use
- Providing tools selecting a sample of channels and assess sampling results
  - After getting list of channels, you can use other tools to export data

- So far vapourware! But prototype [here](https://github.com/AleksiKnuutila/tg_snowball/tree/main)
